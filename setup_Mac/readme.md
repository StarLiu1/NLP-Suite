# Update Instructions

To update the program to the newest version, simply double click update.command. 

The program will also automatically update on exit.

## Shortcuts

Run the `add_terminal_shortcut.command` file by double clicking it. This will add a shortcut to your terminal that will allow you to type `nlp` and automatically be placed into your NLP Anaconda environment as well as in your NLP Suite Directory. You can remove the alias this script creates by running the `remove_terminal_shortcut.command`.
