All schools reported that the events were very well received by students and faculty. Professor Dumbass had never felt so good in his life. Unfortunately, on his very last talk at Truett McConnell University in Cleveland, Georgia, it is reported that Professor Dumbass collapsed at the lectern from sheer exhaustion. Immediate assistance by paramedics could not save his life. He will be missed by two young daughters. It is rumored that neither his wife nor his students will miss him. He seems to have been a very boring man who only came alive in the final days of his life, in the grand tour of his magnum (and only) opus: The Best Dumb Book EVER.
