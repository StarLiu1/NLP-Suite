"""
'strict' to raise a ValueError exception if there is an encoding error. The default value of None has the same effect.
'ignore' ignores errors. Note that ignoring encoding errors can lead to data loss. IT WILL SIMPLY TAKE OUT THE OFFENDING CHARACTER
'replace' causes a replacement marker (such as '?') to be inserted where there is malformed data.
'surrogateescape' will represent any incorrect bytes as code points in the Unicode Private Use Area ranging from U+DC80 to U+DCFF.
   These private code points will then be turned back into the same bytes when the surrogateescape error handler is used when writing data. 
   This is useful for processing files in an unknown encoding.

Opening the file with anything other than 'strict' 
    ('ignore',  'replace', etc.) will let you read 
    the file without exceptions being raised.

Note that decoding takes place per buffered block of data, 
not per textual line. 
If you must detect errors on a line-by-line basis, use the 
surrogateescape handler and test each line read for codepoints 
in the surrogate range
